		<p>
			Michael Francis Egan (September 29, 1761 – July 22, 1814) was a prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. Born in Ireland, he joined the Franciscan Order at a young age. He was ordained a priest, probably in Prague, in 1785 or 1786. He advanced rapidly to positions of responsibility in the Franciscan order, becoming custos (guardian) in the province of Munster in Ireland, then at the Pontifical College at the home of Irish Franciscans in Rome, and later at Ennis in Ireland. Egan arrived in the United States in January 1802 to serve as an assistant pastor near Lancaster, Pennsylvania. His reputation as a gifted preacher secured him a position in 1803 as a pastor at St. Mary's Church in Philadelphia. In 1808, he was appointed the first Bishop of Philadelphia, holding that position until his death in 1814. His tenure as bishop saw the construction of new churches and the expansion of the Catholic Church membership in his diocese, but much of his time was consumed by disputes with the lay trustees of St. Mary's Church.

		<h6>Photograph: Tam McDonald</h6>
		<p>The ballistic missile submarine HMS Vanguard, lead ship of her class, arrives at HMNB Clyde in Faslane, Scotland, following a patrol. Ballistic missile submarines like Vanguard were introduced during the Cold War, and serve as the third leg of the nuclear triad in countries which also operate nuclear-armed land-based missiles and aircraft. Their intended role in the nuclear triad is to provide a second-strike capability in a defensive capacity, or to offer nuclear-armed nations a first-strike weapons platform. In addition to the first- and second-strike capabilities, Vanguard carries a handwritten letter from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom which contains orders on what action to take in the event that an enemy nuclear strike has destroyed the British government.</p>
